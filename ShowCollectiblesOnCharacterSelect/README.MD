# Show Collectibles on Slugcat Select
This mod makes the tokens (or collectibles) appear on character select menu. \
This is threaded and should not impact performance, but it can be switched on and off dynamically from the Remix page. \
This mod requires Rain World Remix to be enabled, and is not compatible with Improved Collectibles Tracker for now :c \
The configurable status will be shown on the mod's Remix Menu description, along with the time it took to load collectibles last time the mod did so.
