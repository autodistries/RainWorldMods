A quick and dirty mod that prevents Epic services from functioning. This is for game version >=1.10.

Does so by renaming Data/Managed/com.playeveryware.eos.core.dll to com.playeveryware.eos.core_disabled.dll.

Yep, Epic Online Services runs in the background even if you're using the game from Steam (or anywhere).Epic also attempts to send telemetry. Me no like telemetry. 

It's not because I have nothing to hide that I want people to know about all of me
