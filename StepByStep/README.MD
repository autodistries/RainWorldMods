This mod lets you completely pause the game (except music) and then continue one frame at a time.

Useful if you want to perform frame-perfect inputs, or analyze a scene without the pause interface, or want to take screenshots in the face of danger


No code for now ! I'm implementing configurable keyboard shortcuts. You can grab the pre-release in the meantime.
P to pause, M to resume, L to step.
