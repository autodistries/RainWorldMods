# Step By Step
This mod lets you stop the game and run it frame by frame.

## Controls
By default, press P to pause and L to step forwards.
Pause happens on the first frame the P key is pressed. You can then release P, the pause will hold.
Resume happens when a different P press is released.

You can configure keybinds and chain speed in the remix menu.
If you press other keys when stepping (or resuming), the game will recieve them and act accordingly.
