# Step By Step
This mod lets you stop the game and run it frame by frame.

## Controls
By default, press P to pause and L to step forwards. You can hold L to do chain multiple steps. Press P again to resume the game normally.
You can configure keybinds and chain speed in the remix menu.
If you press other keys when stepping, the game will recieve them and act accordingly.

## Use cases
Possible use cases include analyzing a situation before reacting, debugging at what frame/action your mod does not work, or practising/performing movment tech at a frame-level precision.

## Plans
- A tool to fake inputs to be frame perfect ? Maybe one that records these imputs ? Or in another mod ?
