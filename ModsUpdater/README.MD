The goal is to allow users to update their mods if they didn't install them from steam

Things could be done from the remix menu interface

There should be a selectable one-item box to choose between updatable mods & mods which IDs don't match anything from the source file

The source file should be fetched every two weeks automatically, and we'll add a button for users to fetch it manually (we will make it so it compares result)



Here how it would be made:
 On menu open, check internet connection (or check only when trying to fetch blob)
 if connected & update is available, auto-download the updated file

 update mods list and sort them:
 - All
 - Update available
 - Not found

 Update all button will update updateable, then prompt a game restart
